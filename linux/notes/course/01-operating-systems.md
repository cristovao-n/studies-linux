# World of Operating Systems

Most OS can be grouped into two families:

-   The Microsoft NT descendants: Windows, Xbox OS, Windows Phone/Mobile
-   Unix descendants: Mac OS X, Linux, Android, Chrome OS, PS4 OS

## Unix:

Unix was an operating system developed in the mid 1960s. Many of the innovations and design choices have lived on 50+ years later, including the idea of multi-user operating systems and hierarchical file systems.

Unix is the “grandfather” of many modern operating systems that we frequently use today.

### Unix Philosophy

Unix philosophy emphasizes modular software design and the creation of small individual programs that can be combined to perform complex tasks.

### True UNIX

The Open Group maintains a set of standards called **the Single UNIX Specification**, which describes the core commands, features, interfaces, utilities, and more that define a UNIX operating system.

The Open Group will certify an operating system as fully UNIX compliant if it passes conformance tests. Companies must pay to be tested and must further pay to use the UNIX trademark.

### Unix-Like

Many operating systems are based on the original UNIX operating systems and are compatible with the UNIX standards, but aren’t considered UNIX because they have not been certified by The Open Group. Often this is because of financial considerations or ethical objections.

We call these operating systems Unix-like. They fully or mostly meet the specification but cannot legally use the UNIX name.

### Free Software movement

The Free Software movement came about in the 1980s as a response to the proliferation of proprietary and restricted software.

According to the movement’s leader, Richard Stallman, _“Users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software”_

### GNU

Richard Stallman was a leader in the group of developers who aimed to create Free Software alternatives to Unix.  
In 1984 he began to work on the GNU project, with the goal of creating an operating system that included “everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not free”

### The Linux Kernel

Linus Torvalds, another developer, was working on creating his own kernel known as Linux. The kernel is the part of an OS that facilitates interactions between hardware and software.

At the time, many GNU components were complete, but it lacked a kernel. Torvals combined his kernel with the existing GNU components to create a full operating system.

### Kernel

A kernel is a computer program that forms the core of an operating system and manages critical tasks like:

-   Memory management
-   Task scheduling
-   Managing hardware

While a Kernel is a critical piece, it’s not the same as an operating system: An engine is the essential “core” of a car, but you can’t drive an engine on its own.

### GNU / Linux

Some users feel strongly that the name GNU / Linux should be used instead, as it properly reflects the GNU project’s contributions.

### Linux Distributions

The Linux Kernel itself isn’t a full-blown operating system. When people talk about a Linux-based operating system, they are referring to Linux distributions.  
Typically, a Linux distribution bundles together the Linux kernel, GNU tools, documentation, a package manager, a window system, and desktop environment.

### Shell

A shell is a computer interface to an operating system.  
Shells expose the OS’s services to human users or other programs.  
The shell takes our commands and gives them to the operating system to perform.

### Terminal

A terminal is a program that runs a shell.  
Originally, terminals were physical devices, but these days we work with software terminals.

### bash

On most Linux-based systems, the default shell program is Bash. There are many other shells, but Bash is currently the most popular.
